I have come to a decision. 
Oh! what`s that?
I don’t want to go to Kandy.
I have been thinking about it.
It sounds fun.
But I don’t want to do it.
What did you just say?
Who are you?
I`ll take water samples.
I can help you.
What happened? 
Did you see that? 
Oh my god. Are you ok? 
He ran over my foot. 
That`s a big deal. 
That`s not a big deal. 
Can I go there? 
Will her mother be there? 
That`s okay then. 
Yes, I think so. 
Nobody hates you. 
Let it go. 
You will never guess what happened. 
I`ll tell you later. 
I have no idea. 
Everything depends on weather conditions. 
I can’t release any information. 
It`ll be fine. 
That`s probably not happening. 
Where are you going? 
We can get out of this together. 
I don’t think so. 
We don’t need him. 
Did you drive her to the airport? 
We have been dying here without you. 
I don’t remember anything. 
He has given them all his personal information. 
You have no intention of going. 
Have you read the emails? 
He is a criminal. 
What does that mean? 
I think he is going to do homework. 
I can find the time.
I know. 
I am so hungry. 
Are you hungry? 
I am not hungry.
Who is they? 
That`s not enough. 
I am not finished. 
Are you finished? 
Are you not finished? 
What do you need, Nalin? 
You always will mean something to me. 
You mean something to me.
It is the truth. 
It is not the truth. 
I will let you know. 
He will let you know. 
I won`t let you know. 
I hired them. 
Did you hire him? 
I won`t hire him. 
I know that. 
I don’t know that. 
How do you know that? 
I am not going after him. 
Are you going after him? 
Why are you going after him? 
I was born for it. 
He was born for it. 
I was born to be a teacher. 
I was born to be a leader. 
She is acting out. 
She is not acting out. 
He may be acting out. 
I am not looking at you. 
What are you looking at? 
You are telling me that he is a liar. 
I am not telling you that he is a liar. 
I am happy. 
Are you happy? 
He is not happy. 
What do you want from me? 
I don’t want anything from you. 
I am not familiar with that song. 
Are you familiar with this? 
I gotta go now. 
Are we ready? 
Take it easy. 
One second. 
It`s so simple. 
What`s this? 
This is just a lesson. 
No worries. 
This is my case. 
That`s right. 
This is old news. 
You and I both lost our future. 
I am on the phone.
